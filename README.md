# simple-toolformer
A Python implementation of [Toolformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) using Huggingface Transformers

This implementation is still a work-in-progress and it wasn't verified to be doing anything useful. 
Therefore, it's intended to be used for educational purposes only.

The main difference compared to the paper is that  I simplified the procedure for sampling API calls from unlabeled texts.
